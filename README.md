# Intelligent-Systems
Project for ***Intelligent Systems*** - University of Pisa.

The tasks performed in this project are the following:

- Design and develop two MLP artifcial neural networks that accurately estimate a
person's valence and arousal and two RBF networks that do the same thing as the MLPs.

- Design and develop a fuzzy inference system to estimate a person's arousal.

- Fine-tune a pretrained CNN to obtain a convolutional neural network (CNN) that
accurately classifes a person's emotion, based on facial expression.
